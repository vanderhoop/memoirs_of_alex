## Memoirs of Alex

This repository contains the recollections of Alex, the default voice of the Mac terminal. I'm gonna give instuctions for playback via [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/yourfriendtrav) whenever a new entry gets added, but if you're impatient, you could simply curl the raw entry and pipe the output to bash, like so:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanderhoop/memoirs_of_alex/master/entries/0001_the_outfield.sh | bash
```
