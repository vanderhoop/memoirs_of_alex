say "Little known fact: I went to primary school with the baseball great, Jose Con SayCoh. One day, out on the school baseball diamond, Jose hit a ball so damn high and so damn far that the entire outfield lost the ball in the sun. We looked for the ball beyond the fence long after Jose had landed those two big powerful feet of his on home plate, but eventually we had to give up the search as futile. Jose has no way of knowing this, but he destroyed our dreams that day, making it clear that as baseball players, we would never be anything more than sad commoners, members of an audience to the greatness of those who were actually meant for the big leagues. Our destinies would have to lie elsewhere."
